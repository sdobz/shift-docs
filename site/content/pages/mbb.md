Shifties love to help when it comes to moving the belongings of other bikers. It's a big social event. Typically the movee provides coffee and light snacks before the ride, and beer and a meal at the end. The move doubles as a house warming party. You should definitely help on somebody else's bike move before asking for help on your own move, partly so you know what you're getting involved in and partly for karma. **This is not a moving service for hire. We do this for friendship and good times, not for money.**

Knowing this, if you would like a herd of bike trailers to show-up at your place to assist your move in a pedal-powered way, then you'll want to reach out to interested volunteers [on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/movebybike/).  For the non-facebookers, try [joining the shift listserv](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/shift) to rally some troops and get some social media help.

**Please give at least a week's notice.**

Also, check [the calendar](http://shift2bikes.org/fun) to avoid a conflict with other rides, and perhaps pay some attention to make sure your move doesn't follow a Midnight Mystery Ride (unless you like a reduced attendance by some hung-over bikers at your Move by Bike event).

## How To Move by Bike

Wanting to give moving by bicycle a try? Here are some tips to get you started:

1. Broadcast the bike move far and wide! Add it to your local bike group's calendar, post it on a blog, do anything you can think of to get the word out. (In Portland, people add it to [Shift's calendar](http://shift2bikes.org/fun), announce it on the [Shift mailing list]((https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/shift)), and also send a reminder on that list the day before the move.) It can help to have a theme, like fancy dress, distinguished tie, or puppet/costume. It really is a party on wheels but you have to make this clear in the invitation, because it's not intuitive. Advertise it as a sort of barn-raising. 

2. Be really, really well prepared day-of so that people can just load-up their bikes and ride. 45 minutes is a pretty good loading-up time to shoot for, allowing plenty of time for people to drink coffee and to accomodate latecomers. 

3. Provide plenty of coffee and donuts at the beginning, and beer and pizza, or something like that, at the end. The best move-by-bikes are when the movee doesn't skimp on this. It costs a lot less than a truck, and makes everyone happy. This is probably the most important item on the list! 

4. Plan out your best route in advance to avoid steep hills and high-traffic streets as much as possible. If you have any major street crossings, sign up people in advance to cork them and give them instructions on when to be at the front of the pack, so the whole parade can get through at its slow, loaded-down place. 

5. Don't worry about weather, but do have lots of tarps if it rains. You'll also want to have lots of bungie cords and tie-downs made out of old bike tubes. 

6. You might need to rent or borrow a truck to finish the job. It's good to have a backup plan, especially if you have a lot of big things and not a lot of big trailers. You'll want to think about the logistics of what can fit on each trailer in advance. 

7. Take pictures and share them online! The more people move by bike, the more people want to move by bike.

<h3>Josh's Short and Spooky Bike Move</h3>
<br>
<b>Starting point:</b> 44 and NE Going<br> 
<b>Ending point:</b> 35 and Alberta <br> 
<b>Date:</b> Saturday, 31 Oct, 2015 <br> 
<b>Time:</b> 11:00am <br> 
<b>Contact:</b> Josh G <br><br>
Sat. Oct 31, 11am leaving from ~44 and NE Going, headed to 35 and Alberta.  Exactly 1 (flat) mile. <b><i>Costumes encouraged</i></b>.   I have a lot of books, etc: dense heavy boxes, and not a ton of Bound bamboo trailer-worthy furniture and bike parts.  If you like hauling a lot of heavy stuff a short distance, this is the move for you. We could use all the help we can get.  Will have all the usual sweets and savories, uppers and downers, vegan and GF.  We will burn things at the end.   <b><i>Costumes still encouraged</i></b>.  An RSVP on facebook or email would be appreciated so I have a vague idea of how much food to get.<br>

I've got some stuff, and I've got a new house. Could use some help uniting the two. Over the river and through the 'hoods we go, with a bit of uphill, a bit of Multi-Use Path, and a lot of beer and edibles at the end. There will also be a little something to fuel people pre-leaving, both caffeinated and nibbly. Mostly boxes and light-to-moderate stuff. But don't worry, there are some challenges in there =)<br>

This will be a gradual uphill move, no steep hills, on mostly quiet city streets.   The busiest street is SE 12th Ave., which has two lanes northbound, so auto traffic will have plenty of room to change lanes and get around us.

<h3>Theo's Lumberjack Move By Bike</h3>

<b>Starting point:</b> 1825 NE 15th Ave<br>

<b>Time:</b> Noon<br> 
<b>Contact:</b> Theo <br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Theo's moving out of his big lonely apartment and into a new house in North Portland, which is apparently the new bike central.<br>
This means bike move! And this time, it's lumberjack themed. Break out your overalls, flannel, and beards galore. Or not. But just come help move if you can.<br>
There's tables, chairs, a shelving unit, rug, dresser, stools, and lots of lots of books for your hauling delight!<br>
<br>
Leave @ 12:30-ish after coffee & donuts.<br>
Lumberjack-approved (Vegan) <b>Chili and Cornbread and Beer</b> to follow. On the new porch. :-)<br>
The move is mostly flat, small slow climb, clocking in at just under 2 miles.<br>
Optional field trip to the Alberta Art Hop after things are unpacked and lumberjack bellies are satisfied.<br>

<h3>Twilight "Liveinsin" Move</h3>

<b>Time:</b> 5:30pm<br> 
<b>Contact:</b> Ed Groth, edward.groth at gmail dat com<br> 
<br> 
<br>
Ed and steph (the "other" one) are shacking up with Emily and Ozge, so what better pre-celebration than a stuff parade via the Springwater?<br>
Lights heartily encouraged, trailers if you got 'em, and yourself and innocent passersby regardless. The cargo is pretty bite-sized, the route a meandering 8-mile vaguely uphill one, and the adventure swashbuckling.<br> 
<br> 
We'll end up in NoPo with enough school-night debauchery to make it worth your while.<br>

How would John Muir move? By bike of course! And so, the Oregon Chapter of<br>
the Sierra Club is moving by bike this Sunday, 8/17 (I apologize for the short<br>
notice) at 12 PM. The starting point is 2950 SE Stark St, Suite 110. The destination<br>
is 1821 SE Ankeny St--a total distance of 0.8 mile on a mostly gentle downhill grade<br>
over low-traffic streets. Very easy. There will be lots of food and drinks at both<br>
ends of the route. <br>
<br>
Considering that this is late notice, you may be already booked this Sunday. If you<br>
happen to have a bike trailer to loan though, please send me an email.<br>
<br>
<b>Report:</b> Besides receiving food and drink we each were rewarded with compact fluorescent bulbs... Now that's a first! <br>

My car free friend Brenda in downtown Vancouver is moving this month! She'd love to see a bike move come across the Columbia and move stuff without running it around in someone else's car. It's about a mile and a half at most, as the bike move rides, from about Franklin and Evergreen to around 29th and Main. As Brenda is a Red Hatter, an obvious theme would be gaudy hats, perhaps even garish. We'll work on rounding up some goodies from Vancouver Pizza, Vancouver's finest pizza according to the Columbian. If you're unsure about the I-5 bridge, let's meet at the Paul Bunyan on Interstate at approximately 10am.<br>

<br> 
Jill and I bought a house at SE 37th and Harrison (between Hawthorne and <br>
Division), and we'll move by bike on Saturday, February 2nd. It's a fairly <br>
easy ride, only two miles, mostly level with one small hill and later a <br>
gradual incline up SE Clinton.<br> 
<br> 
However, we do have quite a bit of stuff. I've got quite a few books and Jill <br>
has lots of stuff related to her arts and craft hobbies. And, we've got quite <br>
a few shelves and such for organizing. If we can get the size of crowd that <br>
showed up for Matt Picio's Extreme Bike Move, then we should be fine. We <br>
could definitely use your help!<br> 
<br> 
We'll have the usual coffee and pastries to fuel up, followed by pizza and <br>
libations at the new house.<br> 
<br> 
On the Move List:<br>
<li>books, shelves, art supplies<br> 
</li>
<li>big arse items include a computer desk and bed<br>

Hope to see you there!<br>

<b>Ending point:</b> 15th and Clinton (short, leisurely ride)<br>

<b>Time:</b> 2:30 p.m.<br> 
<b>Contact:</b> Ken<br> 
<br>
Message: Announcing yet another bike move in this season of bike moves. My friend Hannah (or Leah as she is starting to go by these days), who some of you are bound to know, is moving and wants to do it by bike. She has a studio apartment so it should not be too difficult.<br>
<br>
The late start time gives those going on the hike and bike time to show up and help out. Please bring your trailer to the hike (with a cable lock) and then bike it on over!<br>
<br>
The move is not only small but short. She is only moving to 15th and Clinton. So the move will basically be a leisurely ride through Ladd Addition. Thank you so much for all your help in advance.<br>

<h3>Matt Picio's "Xtreme Cycle" Move</h3>
<br>
Ok, all you folks who want bragging rights, here you go:<br>
<br>
I'm tired of living out in the hinterlands. I'm tired of getting home at<br>
dawn after the MMR. And I'm single again, so I get to live wherever I want<br>
- so I'm moving back to Portland.<br>
<br>
I'm moving from SE 97th & Lawnfield (way the heck out past Clackamas Town<br>
Center) to 1514 SE Salmon. Yes, less than 100' from the intersection of 2<br>
bike boulevards in inner SE. And I need your help.<br>
<br>
So, we have the Extreme Bike Move - 97th & Lawnfield to 16th & Salmon - what<br>
other bike move can you ride the little known bike lane on 82nd Avenue, or<br>
ride past a farm in the middle of suburbia? Not to mention the bragging<br>
rights of doing an 11 mile bike move on a holiday weekend?<br>
<br>
<b>Time:</b> 11am, Saturday, November 24th (Thanksgiving Weekend).<br> 
<b>Place</b>: 13632 SE 97th Avenue<br> 
<b>Goodies:</b> Pastries, Donuts and Coffee at the start, Pizza and Beer at theend. And we're not talking a slice and a beer per person, we're talking<br>
lots of pizza and beer at the end. Help me avoid renting a truck on Sunday<br>
for the remainder!<br>

<h3>Aaron's "Exchange Cycle" Move</h3>
<br>
Aaron's moving, to the Community Exchange Cycle Club house! <br>
<br>
<b>WHEN:</b> Sunday, October 21st, 11:00A<br>

<h3>Organic Brian's Move</h3>
I'm leaving SE Ankeny, and that makes me SAD. :-( <br> 
I'll be on SE Salmon, that makes me GLAD. :-P <br> 
The way I've been treated by my apartment management makes me MAD. :-? <br> 
Good times and good health soon to be HAD. 8-O <br> 
<br> 
Hi, I didn't know this was gonna work out until a few hours ago. I'm bailing out of this apartment, to live in a house that isn't mold-infested. I can maybe not look like I have pinkeye in both eyes all the time! I'll no longer be a short walk from Laurelhurst Theater or the awesome park at da Vinci Middle School, but I will be much closer to the Wunderland nickel arcade/Avalon Theater and the awesome park at Sunnyside School.<br>
<br> <br> 
<b>Some great reasons to help with this Bike Move:</b><br> 
<li>I have some really cute building-mates.<br> 
</li>
<li>The new house is FAB-U-LOUS.<br> 
</li>
<li>Brian has lots of cool stuff to play with: 1950's Singer sewing machine, dual-proc zippy computer, many comics by Jhonen Vasquez (well, don't play with those so much as handle like they're original copies of the Biblical scrolls), a stunt kite, an archive of local bike scene paraphernalia.<br> 
</li>
<li>There will be FREE STUFF.<br> 
</li>
<li>You would meet Brian's PARENTS, who are in town coincidentally on a visit.<br> 
</li>
<br> <br> 
Juice and snacks before moving, we'll all go out to SE Belmont for a sit-down lunch afterwards. Oh yes, I've still got a bottle of wine from Jeff's wedding.<br>
<br> <br> <br>
<h3>Organic Brian's Move</h3>
<b>WHEN:</b> Saturday, August 4th, Noon<br> 
<b>MEET AT:</b> 2434 SE Ankeny St. #2<br>

Ride Report:<br>
As are all bike moves, this one was bike fun. There were about 15 of us. We moved a couple of book cases, a small chest of drawers, house plants, boxes of books, CDs, LPs, an assortment of the usual household goods, a 2 drawer filing cabinet, 2 guitars, a mandolin, a small entertainment center (disassembled), a pair of back country skis, a couple of fishing poles, brewing supplies...OK maybe this is too much information--definitely too much stuff. Anyway, we moved all that stuff about 6.5 miles, through the Pearl, over the Broadway Bridge, up Williams, to NE Going, over to NE 33rd, to NE Skidmore, to NE 34, to NE Alberta Ct, to NE 41st, to my new home. <br>
<br>
Generally, things went smoothly along the route. We had a pedestrian help us cork traffic on NW 21st. Steve mentioned that might be a first. Drivers were nice along the way; everybody loves a bike move. We did seem to have a high incidence of bungee failure but nothing hit the pavement too hard or broke as a result. Oh yeah. We had a cow man! (See photos). <br>
<br>
We had Breakfast on the Bridge to thank for breakfast. Thank you Tami and Timo for bringing the leftover donuts and organic fruit. Once we got to my new home, we chilled in the shade with some pizza, wine, beer, lemonade, and conversation. <br>
<br>
Thank you everyone that helped on the move: Tom, Dan, Gustav, Steve, Kristi, Carye, Matt, Tall Steve, Jeff, Jill, Brad, Aaron, Tami, Timo, and Dr. Wasabi. Thank you all members of the Shift community for establishing and supporting what is now a Portland institution: MoveXBike. <br>
<br>
Here a few photos taken along the way: <br>

The conclusion of this move seems like the end of personal journey. My relocation to Downtown almost two years ago was the result of a life transition. I guess it?s all one big transition though. On to the next adventure! Anyway, moving back out to the Eastside neighborhoods feels like returning home. Here are some pictures of the beginning of the trip (Mother of All Bike Moves, 10/2005) that I never seemed to make time to post until now:<br>

I have to say that I am so fortunate to have met such a wonderful group of folks.<br>

<h3>Kirsty's Aquatic Move</h3>
<br>
Thanks to a bunch of lovely folks for responding to my Move by Bike Query. It sounds like there are enough people who'd love to come and help, so it's on! Here are the details.<br>
<br>
<b>Date -</b> This Sunday, the 7th of January<br>
<b>Time -</b> we'll start loading up at Noon Sharp<br>
<b>Where -</b> at Kirsty's flat, 2086 NW Kearney Street, # 3 - that's the block of flats right on the corner NW 21st & Kearney St<br>
<b>What to bring -</b> your bike trailers, or bike panniers<br>
<b>Moving to -</b> SE 45th & Hawthorne<br>
<b>What needs moving -</b> a double bed, a bookcase, two small tables & chairs, & lots of boxes of clothes, books & other sundries<br>
<b>Theme - Aquatic!</b> It is Portland, and it is January, so it will probably rain. Let's just go with the flow (literally) and have an aquatic themed move. Think fish, mermaids, water bottles, nautical submarines, squeezy bathtub toys, splashy puddles, flippers, pirates on the salty seas, Bill Murray's red woolly hat...<br>
There will be doughnuts and coffee at the start, and a round at the Horse Brass for anyone interested at the end.<br>
<br>
I hope I haven't forgotten anything. Thanks so much everybody! Kirsty x<br>
<br>

<h3>FEMA Move-By-Bike: From Disaster Area to NoPo in No Time Flat</h3>
<br>
It's Time to move Ernie Wisner to Higher Ground!<br>
<br>
You know Ernie -- the guy who got hit by a car in May, during VBC, and has been recuperating in Portland. (He usually visits us by tadpole trike from Coos County, OR). Ernie has to move his minimal gear to new digs -- before he goes in for more surgery on his broken leg at the end of this week.<br>
<br>
Can We Do It? Can we perform an Emergency Move By Bike? There's not much furniture, so a few willing people would make all the difference. The best date is the afternoon of this Wednesday, Dec.13th.<br>
<br>
Ernie will provide libations and "low tide" chow, with fresh Oregon Coast oysters, and vegan option as well.<br>
<br>
Suggested dress: all-weather gear, water wings and white flags optional.<br>
<br>
Contact Matt Phillips for details. Let us know if you have an extra trailer to lend, or would like to borrow a trailer to fully express your emergency management capacity.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Matt (on behalf of Erica and Ernie)<br>
